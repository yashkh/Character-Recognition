The main aim was to show Image Recognition w/ basic Pattern Recognition. In this project, a dataset of 8x8 pixel images is used as a training set to recognize another 8x8 character image. The numArEx.txt file contains a pattern to recognize pixels of the training data set. The imagerec.py file contains the main code to display count of the characters that are a close match to the input character image.
